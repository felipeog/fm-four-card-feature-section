## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) - Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.

### What I learned

I used this challenge to experiment with Web Components. I followed the [MDN's Web Components tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

### Continued development

In a future challenge, I want to experiment with [lifecycle callbacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements#using_the_lifecycle_callbacks).
